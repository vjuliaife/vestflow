//! # VestFlow Contract
//!
//! Trustless token vesting schedules on Stellar / Soroban.
//!
//! ## Re-entrancy Invariant
//!
//! Soroban's host environment does not allow the classic EVM-style re-entrancy
//! because a contract invocation runs to completion before any cross-contract
//! call can trigger a new entry to the same contract.  Despite this guarantee
//! we still include an explicit storage-level re-entrancy guard on the two
//! state-mutating entry points — `claim` and `revoke` — as a defence-in-depth
//! measure and to make the invariant visible in the code.
//!
//! The guard is a simple boolean flag stored under `DataKey::Locked`.  Every
//! mutating entry point acquires the lock on entry and releases it on exit.
//! If a nested call somehow tried to re-enter, the guard would panic with
//! `"Re-entrant call detected"`.
//!
//! ## Error Messages
//!
//! The contract panics with plain string messages that callers can match on.
//! All public-facing error strings are listed below.
//!
//! | Error string                    | Triggered by                                                     |
//! |---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `"Schedule not found"`          | `get_schedule`, `claim`, `revoke` with an unknown ID             |
//! | `"Nothing to claim yet"`        | `claim` called before any tokens have vested                     |
//! | `"Schedule is not revocable"`   | `revoke` called on an irrevocable schedule                       |
//! | `"Already revoked"`             | `revoke` called a second time on the same schedule               |
//! | `"Amount must be positive"`     | `create_schedule` with `total_amount` ≤ 0                        |
//! | `"Duration must be positive"`   | `create_schedule` with `duration` = 0                            |
//! | `"Cliff cannot exceed duration"`| `create_schedule` with `cliff_duration` > `duration`             |
//! | `"Beneficiary must differ from grantor"` | `create_schedule` with `beneficiary == grantor`                 |
//! | `"Re-entrant call detected"`    | A state-mutating entry point is called while already executing   |
//! | `"Upgrade authority already initialized"` | `initialize_upgrade_authority` called more than once |
//! | `"Upgrade authority not initialized"` | Upgrade announcement/execution attempted before authority setup |
//! | `"Unauthorized upgrade authority"` | Upgrade action signed by an address other than the authority |
//! | `"No pending upgrade"` | Upgrade execution/cancellation attempted without an announcement |
//! | `"Upgrade timelock still active"` | Upgrade execution attempted before 48 hours elapsed |
//! | `"Upgrade executable time overflow"` | Upgrade announcement timestamp cannot safely add the timelock |
